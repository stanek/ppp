I want to create a 2 file html page.  1 html file and 1 script file

We will be creating a playable piano

I want to UI to reflect UI.jpg
![My diagram](1/assets/UI.jpg)

The first row is big numbers of the Octave of the keys below it
The second row should have the name of the key (without the octave number)
The third row will be the clickable Key which is colored the same as the piano key that it represents

When this clickable key is held down it will play the sound using tone.js and "https://tonejs.github.io/audio/salamander/" for as long as the key is held down.

The 4th row and below will be a grid which when the square is clicked it toggles between on and off state. for now make them forest green when toggled on
