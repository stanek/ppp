I think you are misunderstanding and maybe it is my fault.  Go back to the original implementation of clicking a single box to toggle it on or off.

lets say i placed 1 box on each of the first 10 lines...

I want to be able to click and drag with my mouse to select a few of them that are in the box.  Make them turn orange... and then add the feature that I can move them around (multiple in the selection) at the same time using the arrow keys.
