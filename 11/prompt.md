I changed the grid lines available to 200.

lets add playback function to the sequencer

Lets have a Stop Pause Play buttons.  Stop will function as a rewind bringing the playback cursor to the top.  Lets have a text input box that accepts numbers to be our tempo for playback speed.

When we hit play a horizontal red line will go from the top row downwards at a constant pace.  When it encounters a filled in box, it will play that corresponding sound.

If the same key is filled in 2 notes in a row, we will consider that to be held down and not release/attack it.
